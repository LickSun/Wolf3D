# Wolf3D

## Description
In this project, it was necessary to create your own engine for the game Wolfenstein 3D. The game is based on Raycasting technology. You can read more information about the technology here (https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting). I use The MinilibX library for rendering (https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx).
Raycasting is done according to the example of the article - https://proglib.io/p/raycasting-for-the-smallest
### How to run
  Run make.
  Run ./minishell test.cub.
  You can run your project with argument "--save" to get the screenshot.
